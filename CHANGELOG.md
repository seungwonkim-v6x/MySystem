# Changelog

All notable changes to MySystem are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [7.4.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **`hooks/update-skills.sh` no longer relies on `flock`.** macOS does not ship `flock`, so v7.4.0's hook silently exited (`flock: command not found` → `|| exit 0`) without ever calling `setup.sh` — same silent-no-op failure mode as the v7.4.0 bug it was meant to fix. Replaced with an atomic `mkdir`-based lock (`.skill-update.lock.d`) cleaned up via `trap EXIT`. Tested end-to-end: hook now actually invokes `setup.sh` and pulls gstack.

## [7.4.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- **External skills are no longer git submodules.** `skills/gstack` is now an independent clone managed by `setup.sh`, always pulled at latest `main` instead of pinned to a fixed commit. SessionStart hook no longer errors out trying to roll back to stale SHAs.
- **`.gitignore` restructured to explicit allow-list.** User-owned skills whitelisted by name; external skills (gstack + anything it installs) stay ignored by default. No maintenance when gstack adds/removes skills.
- **`setup.sh` rewritten.** Now clones/pulls external repos (declared in `EXTERNAL_REPOS`), runs each external repo's own `./setup`, then validates symlinks and agent → skill mappings. Idempotent.
- **SessionStart hook rewritten to match the post-submodule world.** Old `hooks/submodule-auto-update.sh` iterated `git submodule status` (empty after the migration) and so silently stopped updating gstack — local stayed pinned at v1.4.1.0 while upstream moved to v1.15.0.0. New `hooks/update-skills.sh` delegates to `setup.sh` (the SSOT), uses `flock` for single-flight against concurrent sessions, and truncates its log every run so stale errors don't get re-reported every session start.

### Added
- `install.sh` — one-shot installer for new machines. `bash <(curl -fsSL .../install.sh)` backs up any existing `~/.claude`, clones MySystem, and runs `setup.sh`.
- `README.md` — repo landing page with two entry points (ask Claude, or curl one-liner).
- `SETUP.md` — single source of truth for install/update/troubleshoot. Shareable URL you can hand to Claude: "read SETUP.md and execute it."
- CLAUDE.md rule 6: adding an external skill repo → edit `EXTERNAL_REPOS` in `setup.sh` and update the README/SETUP tables; never submodule.

### Removed
- **Submodules deleted (4):** `gstack`, `superpowers`, `playwright-skill`, `code-review-skill`. `.gitmodules` file removed. `.git/modules/skills/*` refs cleaned.
- **Unused skill dirs deleted:** `skills/superpowers/`, `skills/playwright-skill/`, `skills/code-review-skill/`, `skills/systematic-debugging/`, `skills/.gstack-backup-0.11.19.0/`. CHANGELOG 7.3.0 claimed playwright/code-review were removed but the working tree still had them — this release actually applies that removal.

### Rationale
Submodules pin a specific commit, which directly contradicts the "always latest" requirement for gstack (active development, frequent releases). Every SessionStart hook was failing to `git submodule update` because the pinned SHA kept rolling back manual gstack upgrades. The new model: declare the dependency (in `setup.sh`), let git clone freely, never pin.

Trade-off: MySystem no longer snapshots exact versions of external skills at release time. Acceptable because (a) gstack releases its own semver; (b) reproducibility for a personal config repo matters less than staying current; (c) the declaration in `setup.sh` is readable and diff-friendly.

## [7.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### Removed
- **mempalace system fully removed.** 30-day usage analysis showed ~5 queries/day average and zero writes in the last 5 days; ROI did not justify the ~3,000 tokens injected per session. gstack's local storage (`~/.gstack/projects/`) plus per-project `.claude/memory/` cover the same needs with less overhead.
  - `~/.claude.json`: removed `mempalace` MCP server
  - `settings.json`: removed SessionStart wake-up hook, Stop auto-mine hook, and mempalace-related permissions/directories
  - `hooks/mempalace-wake-up.sh`, `hooks/mempalace-auto-mine.sh`: deleted
  - `~/.mempalace/palace/` data preserved (recoverable if needed)
- **Unused plugins removed**: `context7`, `playwright`, `figma`, `frontend-design` (all `claude-plugins-official`). Duplicates of global MCPs or unused.
- **Unused MCP servers removed** (`~/.claude.json`): `pencil`, `Framelink Figma MCP`, `chrome_devtools` (overlaps with Playwright).
- **Unused skills removed (20)**: benchmark, benchmark-models, canary, cso, design-consultation, design-html, design-shotgun, devex-review, plan-devex-review, plan-tune, make-pdf, pair-agent, connect-chrome, context-restore, context-save, health, learn, open-gstack-browser, playwright-skill, code-review-skill.

### Rationale
- Token savings: roughly 6,000–7,000 tokens per session start.
- gstack local storage already integrates with the team-shared `.claude/memory/` + `MEMORY.md` auto-load flow. The mempalace KG/drawer/tunnel abstractions were over-engineered for the actual usage pattern.

## [7.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Boil the Lake (Completeness Principle)** section in CLAUDE.md — recommend the complete implementation over shortcuts; AI makes the last 10% cost near-zero. Flag "oceans" (rewrites of systems you don't control) as out of scope.
- **Repo Mode (Solo vs Collaborative)** in CLAUDE.md — agent behavior adapts to who owns issues. Solo repos (cc-guard, MySystem): proactive fixes for noticed issues. Collaborative repos (vProp): flag-only, default to asking. "See Something, Say Something" rule — never let a noticed issue silently pass.
- **Step 6 Verification** — added `/design-review` option. Options expanded to A(전부)/B(verify-test)/C(qa-only)/D(design-review)/E(기능 둘 다)/F(skip). UI 변경 없는 작업에는 design-review 자동 제외.

### Rationale
- gstack `/review`가 이미 Codex adversarial을 자동 실행(50+ line 기준)하므로 별도 `/codex` 스텝은 중복 — 추가하지 않음.
- `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`는 vProp처럼 팀 리뷰/머지 흐름이 있고 Vercel+Sentry로 관측되는 환경엔 과함 — 기본 플로우에서 제외.
- 위 두 원칙(Boil the Lake, Repo Mode)은 gstack 철학 중 플로우 변경 없이 판단 기준으로 흡수할 가치가 가장 높음.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- Context Management: replaced "Compact at 50%" manual rule with auto-compaction via `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=25`. Opus 4.7 (1M context) triggers auto-compaction at ~250K tokens, much earlier than the 83% default — Opus 4.7 burns tokens too fast for the default threshold.
- settings.json: added `env.CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=25`, `effortLevel: xhigh` (Opus 4.7 default), permissions (Skills for office-hours/autoplan/review/ship, editJiraIssue, vprop libs/src/image, stripe list_subscriptions), additionalDirectories (cc-guard subdirs, verify-test tmp dirs).
- hooks: added `SessionEnd` cc-guard learn; `PreToolUse` Bash uses absolute path to `cc-guard check`.

## [7.0.1] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- mempalace-auto-mine.sh: `--extract general` for structured memory extraction (decision/problem/milestone instead of raw exchange snippets).
- settings.json: added permissions (Slack search, Notion search, Playwright, cc-guard hook, mempalace), additional directories, PreToolUse cc-guard hook.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Removed custom ensemble system entirely. Coordinator now invokes gstack skills directly.
- **Breaking**: CLAUDE.md rewritten (213→113 lines). Gstack-native execution model.
- Workflow step 6 (Verification) now presents 4 options: both, verify-test only, qa-only only, or skip.
- settings.json: removed PreToolUse Agent hook, removed disabled plugins, cleaned permissions.
- settings.local.json: wildcard permission consolidation (96→41 entries).

### Added
- Context Management section in CLAUDE.md (/compact at 50%, /rewind, /clear).
- `<important if>` conditional tag for Repo Self-Management.
- submodule-auto-update.sh: error reporting via additionalContext on SessionStart.
- `cc-update` alias in ~/.zshrc for daily Claude Code updates.

### Removed
- 10 custom agent definitions (kept only ralph-planner.md).
- `require-subagent-type.sh` hook (ensemble enforcement no longer needed).
- Ensemble Execution Rule, Subagent Permission Rules sections from CLAUDE.md.
- `superpowers` and `feature-dev` disabled plugin entries from settings.json.

## [5.8.1] - 2026-04-15 (rollback)

### Reverted
- Rolled back from v6.0.0 to v5.8.1. Reverted CLAUDE.md and VERSION.
- v5.9.0 (Ralph Autonomous Mode) and v6.0.0 (ensemble removal, workflow unification) changes undone.
- `agents/ralph-planner.md` retained as it's a standalone addition.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Removed ensemble (3x subagent per step). Each step now calls 1x subagent directly.
- **Breaking**: Interactive vs Ralph difference reduced to approval only. Same workflow, same agents.
- **Breaking**: Ralph switched from screen + `claude -p` to Ralph Loop plugin (Stop Hook based).
- Simplified subagent invocation: call via `subagent_type` directly, coordinator must not re-interpret or re-inject skill content.
- Only /autoplan retains 3 subagents (role division: CEO + Design + Eng).
- Updated ralph-start and ralph-report skills to Ralph Loop plugin based.

### Removed
- Ensemble Execution Rule section entirely
- 3x parallel subagent execution pattern
- screen + ralph-autonomous.sh based autonomous execution

## [5.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Ralph Autonomous Mode**: Autonomous execution of MySystem workflow while user is away. Each iteration = 1 task x 1 workflow step. Steps 1~8 auto-execute, /ship always requires human.
- **`ralph-planner` agent** (`agents/ralph-planner.md`): Detailed implementation plan writer for autonomous execution
- **Ralph runtime** (`~/.claude/ralph/{project}/`): ralph-autonomous.sh (main loop), next-step.py (task/step selection), advance-step.py (step advancement, atomic write), safety-autonomous.md (safety rules)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Ralph Autonomous Mode section (Interactive vs Autonomous comparison, safety measures, file locations)
- **Available Custom Subagents table**: Added `ralph-planner`

### Design Decisions
- Runtime files stored outside repo (`~/.claude/ralph/`) to avoid git status pollution
- Reuses existing agents (`--agent` flag) — no separate methodology prompts needed
- Single agent per step (not ensemble) — 1/3 token cost, suitable for autonomous execution
- `--disallowed-tools` CLI hard block + `safety-autonomous.md` soft block dual safety

## [5.8.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Central mempalace wing configs** (`mempalace/wings/vprop/`): moved `mempalace.yaml` and `entities.json` out of project directories into MySystem so they don't pollute project git status/diff

## [5.8.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **3 external skill submodules**: `code-review-skill` (React/TS/Vue review), `playwright-skill` (E2E tests), `superpowers` (systematic-debugging)
- **Submodule auto-update hook** (`submodule-auto-update.sh`): SessionStart fetches latest for all submodules in background, restores broken symlinks if updated
- **systematic-debugging** skill symlink from superpowers

### Changed
- `investigator` agent: added `systematic-debugging` skill (4-phase execution guardrails)
- `code-reviewer` agent: added `cso` (OWASP/STRIDE) + `code-review-skill` (React 19/TS review)
- `eng-reviewer` agent: added `health` (code quality dashboard)
- `test-verifier` agent: added `playwright-skill` (E2E test generation)

## [5.7.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **setup.sh**: Clone-and-run bootstrap script — inits gstack submodule, restores broken skill symlinks, verifies all agent → skill mappings. Run `cd ~/.claude && ./setup.sh` on any new machine.

## [5.6.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **MemPalace integration**: Replaced claude-mem with MemPalace for persistent memory (raw verbatim storage, 96.6% R@5 retrieval)
- **SessionStart hook** (`mempalace-wake-up.sh`): Injects MemPalace L0+L1 wake-up context (~170 tokens) at every session start
- **Stop hook** (`mempalace-auto-mine.sh`): Auto-mines session transcript into MemPalace on session end
- **MCP server** (`mempalace`): Registered as user-scope MCP for semantic search across all sessions

### Removed
- **claude-mem**: Plugin uninstalled, launchd workers/updater removed

### Changed
- Subagent models switched from opus to sonnet (cost reduction)

## [5.5.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **3 new custom subagents**: `office-hours`, `slow-downer`, `test-verifier` — every ensemble step now has a dedicated subagent with preloaded skills
- **PreToolUse hook** (`require-subagent-type.sh`): Blocks Agent calls without `subagent_type`. Hard enforcement — coordinator cannot bypass by using generic Agent(model: "opus")

### Changed
- Step Details table: all steps now reference named subagents, no more "generic" entries
- All 10 subagents have `skills:` frontmatter for automatic SKILL.md preloading

## [5.4.2] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Enforce subagent_type usage**: Added CRITICAL rule + correct/wrong examples to prevent coordinator from ignoring custom subagents and spawning generic `Agent(model: "opus")` with inline prompts instead

## [5.4.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **/autoplan two-phase flow**: Coordinator must write a plan via EnterPlanMode, get user approval via ExitPlanMode, THEN pass the full approved plan to CEO/Design/Eng reviewers. Previously coordinator was skipping the plan phase and writing its own inline summary directly into subagent prompts.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Correct subagent invocation**: Rewrite CLAUDE.md to use `Agent(subagent_type: "name")` pattern
- **Skills preloading**: Add `skills:` frontmatter to agent files — SKILL.md content is preloaded at session start, no runtime file reads needed
- **Agent frontmatter hardened**: Add `permissionMode: dontAsk`, `effort: high` to all agent definitions
- **Execution Steps / Step Details consistency**: Both now unified around `subagent_type` invocation

### Fixed
- Disconnect between Execution Steps (inline prompts) and Step Details (custom agent names) resolved
- Subagents no longer need to read SKILL.md at runtime — replaced with skills preloading

## [5.3.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Custom Subagents** (`~/.claude/agents/`): 7 dedicated subagent definitions created
  - `ceo-reviewer.md`, `design-reviewer.md`, `eng-reviewer.md` (role-based for /autoplan)
  - `code-reviewer.md`, `bug-hunter.md` (dedicated for /review and /bugbot)
  - `investigator.md`, `researcher.md` (dedicated for /investigate and /research)
- Each agent embeds its own model, tools, and instructions — no more passing long prompts at runtime

### Changed
- Step Details table: skill file references replaced with custom subagent references
- Subagent invocation: Agent tool + inline prompts replaced with pre-defined `.claude/agents/` files

## [5.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **/autoplan**: Same skill x3 replaced with role-based subagents (Agent 1=CEO, Agent 2=Design, Agent 3=Eng). Each subagent reads and executes its own role's SKILL.md.
- **Implementation**: Excluded from ensemble, coordinator runs directly (needs file write permissions)

## [5.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Opus-only ensemble**: Subagent model changed from sonnet to opus. Codex CLI and Gemini CLI removed (unstable).
- **Subagents run skills internally**: Coordinator no longer extracts/summarizes methodology. Each subagent reads SKILL.md and runs the full methodology itself.
- **Fixed at 3 perspectives**: 3 opus subagents. Coordinator only synthesizes.

### Fixed
- Coordinator was proceeding after only 1 subagent returned — now waits for ALL 3
- Coordinator was advancing to next workflow step without user approval — now requires explicit approval after every step
- Subagent prompts were truncated to ~300 chars — now require full context + "read SKILL.md yourself" instruction

### Removed
- Codex CLI integration (unstable invocation)
- Gemini CLI integration (unstable invocation)

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Base reverted to v3.3.0**: Rolled back Scion-based v4.x architecture. Step-detail table (v4.2.0) retained.
- **Ensemble fixed at 5 perspectives**: 3 Claude sonnet subagents + Codex CLI + Gemini CLI. Removed "3-5" variable range.
- **Codex CLI flags updated**: `--read-only` to `-s read-only`, `--write` to `-s workspace-write` (Codex v0.118.0)
- **Repo Self-Management**: Skill sync changed from copy to symlink

### Added
- **Gemini CLI v0.36.0**: Added as cross-model voice alongside Codex (`gemini -p "<prompt>" --approval-mode plan -o text`)
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue with Claude ensemble alone if Codex/Gemini CLI fails
- **Long diff handling**: tmp file + stdin pipe pattern documented

### Removed
- **Scion CLI dependency**: "THE ONE RULE" (mandatory scion-ensemble first call) removed
- **Docker/Scion container ensemble**: 4-agent Scion architecture fully removed
- **Per-step prose descriptions**: Replaced with step-detail table

### Fixed
- v4.x workflow failing every session due to Scion CLI not being installed
- Codex CLI v0.118.0 flag compatibility

## [4.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Complete CLAUDE.md rewrite**: reduced from 190 lines to 70 lines. One rule at the top: "your first tool call is /scion-ensemble". Everything else supports that one rule.
- **"THE ONE RULE" pattern**: instead of 10+ CRITICAL/NEVER/MANDATORY directives that agents ignore, one clear behavioral instruction that's impossible to misinterpret.
- **Table-based step details**: replaced verbose per-step prose with a compact table mapping step → skill file → what to extract.
- **Removed redundant rules**: "ZERO discretion", "NEVER skip", "NEVER reorder" etc. all consolidated into workflow ordering + "user interrupts if they want to skip".

### Fixed
- Agent was reasoning "this is overkill" and skipping ensemble because the old CLAUDE.md had too many rules competing for attention. New version has one rule.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Step Details rewritten**: every step now explicitly reads the relevant skill's SKILL.md, extracts the methodology, and inlines it into the /scion-ensemble task prompt. Prevents agents from ignoring ensemble and running solo.
- **Methodology extraction pattern**: Gemini/Codex can now follow gstack skill methodologies (investigate 4-phase, review criteria, etc.) even though they can't read SKILL.md files directly — the methodology is embedded in the task prompt.
- **No diff/non-diff distinction**: all steps use /scion-ensemble uniformly. Same prompt for all 4 agents.

### Fixed
- Agent was ignoring Ensemble Execution Rule and running skills directly (solo) because Step Details said "Run /investigate" without mentioning /scion-ensemble.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **scion-ensemble skill**: New `/scion-ensemble` custom skill that spawns a 4-agent multi-model ensemble: 1 local Claude (Agent tool) + 3 Scion containers (Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Codex). Collects results and synthesizes into Consensus / Unique catches / Disagreements.
- **poll-agents.sh**: Standalone polling script for Scion agent completion. Supports per-model timeouts, quorum checking, and timestamped agent names.
- **Scion integration**: Diff-based workflow steps (review, bugbot) now use Google Scion for container-isolated multi-vendor AI review.

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Ensemble Execution Rule rewritten. Diff-based steps (review, bugbot) use `/scion-ensemble` (4 agents, 3 vendors). Non-diff steps retain the old Agent tool + Codex pattern until Phase 2.
- **Breaking**: Requires Scion CLI + Docker for full ensemble. Falls back to local-only Agent tool ensemble if unavailable.
- Step 7 (/review) and Step 8 (/bugbot) now reference `/scion-ensemble` instead of "Codex runs in parallel"

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Research-backed ensemble: structured perspectives, not just paraphrasing

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Ensemble Execution Rule**: Every workflow step spawns 3-10 identical subagents in parallel, synthesizes results into one report. Core leverage of the system.
- **Step 3: /research**: New mandatory step — search docs, codebase, existing solutions before planning. Uses search-first + documentation-lookup skills.
- **Step 6: /verify-test**: New mandatory step — generate throwaway code-based tests, run them, delete after. Tests never committed.
- **search-first skill**: Copied from affaan-m/everything-claude-code. Research existing tools/libraries before writing code.
- **documentation-lookup skill**: Copied from affaan-m/everything-claude-code. Fetch live docs via Context7 MCP.
- **verify-test skill**: Custom. Generate, run, and discard code-based verification tests.
- **Subagent Permission Rules**: Read-only by default (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash). Only coordinator can write files or use git.

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Workflow expanded from 7 steps to 9 steps (added /research and /verify-test)
- **Breaking**: Debugging flow expanded (added /research step)
- Ensemble rule applies to ALL steps (not just review/bugbot)

## [2.3.3] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Clarified that /autoplan runs IMMEDIATELY after /slow-down approval, no asking
- "Plan acceptance ≠ plan review" — ExitPlanMode does not replace /autoplan
- Agent was skipping /autoplan entirely after user accepted a plan

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Added "NEVER reorder steps" and "NEVER write code before /slow-down and /autoplan are done"
- Agent was running /investigate then jumping straight to implementation, skipping /slow-down and /autoplan entirely

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Clarified that agent must NEVER ask "should we skip?" or suggest skipping
- User interrupts if they want to skip — agent just runs the next step

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **Breaking**: ALL workflow steps are now MANDATORY — agent has ZERO discretion to skip
- Removed all IF/THEN conditional logic that allowed agent to judge whether a step applies
- Only the user can skip a step by explicitly saying "skip [step]"
- Debugging flow also requires /slow-down and /autoplan (no shortcuts)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md for version history tracking
- Repo self-management rules in CLAUDE.md: agents must bump VERSION, update CHANGELOG, create git tag, and sync global files on every change

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- Workflow now has 7 explicit numbered steps, not just 3 gates
- Every skill (office-hours, autoplan, plan-*, review, bugbot, ship) has a designated position with IF/THEN trigger rules
- Added debugging flow: /investigate → /slow-down → implementation → /review → /bugbot → /ship
- Added weekly retrospective: /retro with explicit trigger condition
- Removed separate "Skill Inventory" table — skills are defined by their workflow position

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **Breaking**: All content rewritten in English (was Korean)
- **Breaking**: CLAUDE.md restructured as enforceable IF/THEN gates (was advisory workflow)
- slow-down SKILL.md rewritten in English with original article quotes

### Added
- gstack added as git submodule at skills/gstack/
- VERSION file for version tracking

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Initial setup: CLAUDE.md, settings.json, bugbot skill
- slow-down skill: 5-step pre-coding concretization process
- Global workflow rules: slow-down (mandatory) + bugbot (mandatory)
